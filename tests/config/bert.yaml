# Each model can have multiple inputs
# Each input has a dtype, device and shape
# Some shapes can be arbitrary like a positive integer for batch size

# HuggingFace BERT model
input1: # batch size
  dtype: "int32"
  device: "cpu"
  shape: [1,1] # the first element is the batch size and second element is the sequence length
  high : 10 # max value
  mode : "latency"
